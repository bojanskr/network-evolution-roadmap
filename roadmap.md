## Roadmap

### Abstract
This document aims to provide W3C groups and developers with a broad overview of the evolution of the mobile network between 2015 and 2020. This can be used to develop standards that are operator-network-aware ensuring technologies do not clash between the web and the mobile operator network.

### Introduction
Quick overview of the document - aims including "a roadmap of the expected evolution of mobile networks which have potential impacts on Web applications".

### Terminology

CDMA2000 | 3G mobile technology for sending voice, data, and signaling data between mobile phones and cell sites. It is developed by 3GPP2 and used especially in North America and South Korea.
CDMA2000 1X | Voice standard of CDMA2000
CDMA2000 1xEV-DO | Data standard of CDMA2000. Revision A introduced protocols, new forward link data rates and quality of service flags to allow for use cases such as VoIP. Revision B improved the standard by managing edge-of-cell signal, using multiplexing to reduce latency and higher rates satisying use cases such as high definition video streaming.
GSM | 2G standard developed by the standards body ETSI. It operators in 219 countries as of 2014. It originally had no data requirements, later it expanded to include data communications including GPRS (around 56–114 kbit/s) and EDGE standards (around 400–1000 kbit/s).
WCDMA | 3G mobile technology for voice, text, MMS and data communications. 
WCDMA HSPA | Data communications which extends WCDMA using shared channel, higher modulation and other methods to increase rates  (around 7–42 Mbit/s). HSPA+ extends these data rates up to 84 Mbit/s. In 2011 HSPA+ was operational in 170 countries.
